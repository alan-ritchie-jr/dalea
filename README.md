# dalea_2018

MSc thesis chapter 2 dataset
Observational data gathered summer 2018 from Strandenss Prairie
Tracked flowering phenology, pollinator visitation, and seed set in Dalea purpurea that was either burned or not burned
Dalea is a pyrophilic plant--flowers aggressively after fire. Does fire or pollination have a stronger impact on seed set?

Tested structural equation model to evaluate relative strength of prescribed fire vs pollinator visitation rates 

Code includes data cleaning, diagnostic figures, and model code. Models were tested using both Lavaan (traditional SEM) and piecewiseSEM (for random effects parameterization)
